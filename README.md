# radiant-economics
The repository of Johann Kotaro's crazy ideas.
I created this repository to store various things related to my field, Economics. 
My name is Johann Kotaro, I'm a college student of Economics, and I'm passionate about data and business intelligence. 
I always try to contribute, even if just a little, to changing the world and the individuals who live in it.
