## Why Radiant?
    In The Elder Scrolls series, Radiant Quests are procedurally generated or semi-randomized missions designed to provide an endless supply of tasks for the player. These quests often adapt to the player's actions, location, or progression in the game.
    These are just my radiant ideas.
